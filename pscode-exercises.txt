// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If inputted number is divisible by 2, print "even"
If inputted number is not divisible by 2 print "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Read in 5 different numbers
Set sum to 0
Read numbers and add to sum
Set average to sum / 5
Set smallest to A and largest to B
Read numbers
If number < A set smallest to A
If number > B set largest to B
Print "the average of the 5 numbers is: " + average
Print "the smallest number is: " + A
Print "the largest number is: " + B
